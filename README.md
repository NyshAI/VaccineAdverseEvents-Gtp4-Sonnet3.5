# Analyzing Temporal and Associative Relationships of Vaccine Adverse Events for Hepatitis B vaccination

## Background and Goal:
Analyzing adverse events in the vaccine is essential for ensuring vaccine safety. With large datasets like Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting Systems (VAERS) capturing a wide range of reported vaccine adverse events, it becomes important to examine the temporal patterns and associations between them. In this project, the primary objective is to identify and uncover critical temporal relationships and associations of these adverse events with advanced natural language processing techniques.

## Essential Terminology:

### Hepatitis B
Hepatitis B is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). It can range from a mild, short-term illness to a chronic, long-term condition. The virus primarily spreads through contact with infected body fluids, which may occur through blood transfusions, sharing needles, sexual contact, or from mother to child during childbirth.
